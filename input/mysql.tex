\noindent I used the Mysql database for my project. It is world''s most popular open source database It 
is a relational database management system (RDBMS) that runs as a server 
providing multi-user access to a number of databases. It is named after 
developer Michael Widenius's daughter, My. The SQL phrase stands for
Structured Query Language. MySQL is written in C and C++.\\

\noindent Free-software-open source projects that require a 
full-featured database management system
often use MySQL. MySQL is also used in many high-profile, large-scale World 
Wide Web products, including
Wikipedia, Google (though not for searches) and Facebook.\\

\noindent MySQL is a popular choice of database for use in web 
applications, and is a central component of the widely used LAMP web 
application software LAMP is an acronym for “Linux, Apache, MySQL, 
Perl/PHP/Python”. MySQL is used in some of the most frequently visited web sites 
on the Internet, including Flickr, Nokia.com, YouTube, Wikipedia, Google 
and Facebook.\\

\noindent One of the greatest advantage of Django is that it synchronises the 
database only with one command withouut having any need to send 
different queries for insertion, deletion, updation etc. There is a 
file named models.py which is used for purpose of creating database.
