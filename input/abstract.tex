â€˜E-learning comprises all forms of electronically supported learning and teaching. The information and communication systems, whether networked learning or not, serve as specific media to implement the learning process. The term will still most likely be utilized to reference out-of-classroom and in-classroom educational experiences via technology, even as advances continue in regard to devices and curriculum.\\

\noindent Elearning was made keeping in mind that the various schools and colleges who spend several man hours, which often run into days, giving students assignments and other class related work. This project will not only help them significantly reduce the time consumed in giving the assignments and other class related work, but will also make the overall process very simple and easy to use.\\

\noindent The motive of the project is to reduce the time consumed and to enable fast and
easy customization and even faster processing of class work when required as instead of writing and
scaling, only values in the php script need to be changed.\\

\noindent Also, this project is completely open source and is made using HTML, CSS, PHP and MySql and the entire code is available to the user as and when required. There is also a Complete Documentation as well as User manual alongwith it for making the 
developing and using the software a lot easier.
